/**
 * When being run with {@link UninstallMultiscopedTest} then this test emulates
 * {@link LazyParams#uninstall()} during static initialization for a test that
 * then introduces parameter during Jupiter static scope - e.g. from a
 * {@link BeforeAll @BeforeAll} method.
 * This is a regression test for a bug that prevented proper implicit reinstall
 * in static scope. What happened was that the {@link org.lazyparams.core.Lazer}
 * instance of the first implicit installation was lost - except for info on its
 * pending repetition, which forced a repetition of static scope but with a new
 * {@link org.lazyparams.core.Lazer} instance, which somehow replaced the first
 * one and was then prevailed for the remainder of the test execution.
