# LazyParams
LazyParams is a powerful parametrization solution for JUnit (versions 4 and 5). It provides the test developer with easy ways to convert a regular test into a parameterized test that can have one or many parameters, which can be seamlessly combined to achieve pairwise testing.

The parametrization API does not have any annotations. Instead there is an imperative API to use during the test execution. Therewith the parametrization is of a lazy nature, because the test can start off as a regular test execution without parameters and then turn into a parameterized test as the first parameter is introduced during the test-execution.

## Best-Practice Feature API [LazyParams#pickValue(...)](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/LazyParams.html) and execution path evaluation

### ... One parameter ...
First example:
```
@Test
public void smallInt() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 4);
  assertThat(myInt).isLessThan(5);
}

// With ConsoleLauncher the test result is presented like this:
//  smallInt() ✔
//  ├─ smallInt int=3 ✔
//  ├─ smallInt int=2 ✔
//  └─ smallInt int=4 ✔
```
Above test uses the best practice API of feature class [LazyParams](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/LazyParams.html). First argument of above [#pickValue(...)](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/LazyParams.html#pickValue(java.lang.String,T,T...)) invocation specifies parameter-name, which will be part of the test-name. Additional arguments define possible parameter values.
Fine-grained customization on how to display parameter value is 
achieved with a separate pickValue-method, which first parameter is of type [ToDisplayFunction](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/ToDisplayFunction.html), which method takes parameter value as argument. E.g. instead of parameter name, a lambda expression can be used:
```
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue(
          i -> 1==i ? "1st" : 2==i ? "2nd" : 3==i ? "3rd" : i + "th",
          3, 2, 4);

//  smallInt() ✔
//  ├─ smallInt int=3rd ✔
//  ├─ smallInt int=2nd ✔
//  └─ smallInt int=4th ✔
```
There is one special method [pickValue(Enum...)](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/LazyParams.html#pickValue(E...)) that promotes enum parameters. Its only parameter is a vararg Enum array with the parameter values. Empty vararg array means all constants of parameter enum-type are possible values. With this method the enum constant #toString() describes the value in test-name. E.g. if parameter type is [RetentionPolicy](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html) then a test could look like this:
```
@Test
public void policy() {
  RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
  assertThat(myPolicy).isNotNull();
}

//  policy() ✔
//  ├─ policy SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ policy CLASS ✔
//  └─ policy RUNTIME ✔
```
### ... Two parameters ...
Let's have values from the aboe parameters "myInt" and "myPolicy" picked in the same test:
```
@Test
public void twoParams() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 3);
  RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
}

// Test-result will contain nine executions:
//  twoParams() ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 CLASS ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=4 RUNTIME ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 CLASS ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=4 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 RUNTIME ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 RUNTIME ✔
//  └─ twoParams int=4 CLASS ✔
```
All parameter combinations are tested. This is because LazyParams attmpts to seek out all possible paired combinations of the two parameters' values.

What if test execution only introduces second parameter "myPolicy" when "myInt" is 2? ...
```
@Test
public void twoParams() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 4);
  if (2 == myInt) {
    RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
  }
}

//  twoParams() ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 CLASS ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=4 ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 SOURCE ✔
//  └─ twoParams int=2 RUNTIME ✔
```
LazyParams notices how end-of-the-road is hit when myInt has value 3 or 4 - and that it's necessary to choose int=2 on the last couple of test repetitions in order to unlock the execution path that allows evaluation of the pending policy values.
In the above example the condition that unlocks execution path for introducing "policy" is hardwired - but even without a hardwired condition it would still be possible for the repetion execution paths to unfold like this if repetitions for "myInt" 3 and 4 causes a test-failure before "policy" is introduced.

Let's instead have the other myInt values unlock "policy" introduction:
```
@Test
public void twoParams() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 4);
  if (3 <= myInt) {
    RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
  }
}

//  twoParams() ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=2 ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=4 CLASS ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 RUNTIME ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=4 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ twoParams int=3 CLASS ✔
//  └─ twoParams int=4 RUNTIME ✔
```
With policy execution path enabled by two myInt values there are again some pairwise combinations for LazyParams to navigate!

### ... Three parameters ...
Now have an additional parameter "extra" combined with both parameters from above section:
```
@Test
public void threeParams() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 3);
  RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
  String extra = LazyParams.pickValue("extra", "x","y","z");
}

//  threeParams() ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 SOURCE extra=x ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 CLASS extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=4 RUNTIME extra=z ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 CLASS extra=z ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=4 SOURCE extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 RUNTIME extra=x ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 RUNTIME extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 SOURCE extra=z ✔
//  └─ threeParams int=4 CLASS extra=x ✔
```
With 3 parameters of 3 values each there are actually 27 possible combinations (3x3x3) but there are only 9 repetitions. This is because the pairwise combinatorial reduction has kicked in as there are here three parameters which are all introduced on each repetition, regardless of execution path (as long as there is no failure). LazyParams here attempts to ensure each value of myInt (3,2 & 4) is combined at least once with each value of "policy" and "extra" - and also values of "policy" and "extra" are combined at least once with each other.

In total LazyParams identifies 27 value pairs, each to be tried at least once. This time it managed to walk through all pairs with just 9 repetitions, because it managed to try three new pairs in each repetition. (I.e. in the 1st repetition there are `int=3 SOURCE`, `int=3 extra=x` and `SOURCE extra=x`. In the 2nd repetition there are `int=2 CLASS`, `int=2 extra=y` and `CLASS extra=y` etc.)

What if "extra" is not introduced for policy SOURCE:
```
@Test
public void threeParams() {
  int myInt = LazyParams.pickValue("int", 3, 2, 3);
  RetentionPolicy myPolicy = LazyParams.pickValue();
  if (RetentionPolicy.SOURCE == myPolicy) {
    return;
  }
  String extra = LazyParams.pickValue("extra", "x","y","z");
}

//  threeParams() ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 SOURCE ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 CLASS extra=x ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=4 RUNTIME extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 RUNTIME extra=z ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=4 CLASS extra=z ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 CLASS extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=4 RUNTIME extra=x ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 CLASS extra=y ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 RUNTIME extra=z ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=3 CLASS extra=x ✔
//  ├─ threeParams int=2 SOURCE ✔
//  └─ threeParams int=4 SOURCE ✔
```
With conditional introduction of parameter "extra" the number of possible parameter combinations is down from 27 (3x3x3) to only 21. Therefore it's kind of a paradox how the number of repetitions went the opposite way - up from 9 to 12.
But this is indeed to fewest number of repetitions required to make execution paths cover all possible value pairs. Since SOURCE is end-of-the-line it requires 3 repetitions to combine with all three myInt values - but none of these repetitions will cover any pairs for parameter "extra", which will require at least 9 repetitions (3x3) in order to statisfy all pair combinations with myInt. This means at least 12 repetitions are here required to satisfy all pairs. ("extra" will not combine with SOURCE, so only "policy" values RUNTIME & CLASS means 6 repetitions (3x2) for all possible "policy"-"extra" pairs, which are easily satisfied under the radar while the 9 "myInt"-"extra" pairs are navigated)
So LazyParams managed to reach the lowest posible number of repetitions (12) to satisfy all pairs here but do also notice how parameter pick int=3 and SOURCE happened first and thereafter were only repeated after all pairs without them had been satisfied. I.e. after int=3 and SOURCE were branded as not introducing "extra" then LazyParams prioritized the other values, which didn't-prevent parameter "extra", and had them form all possible pairs with the three "extra" values before revisiting int=3, which was then given higher priority as it turned out to not prevent "extra". - And finally the two remnaining pairs (int=2 SOURCE) and (int=4 SOURCE) were checked off.
The purpose of the above - volatile - prioritization of parameter values is to uncover potentially hidden execution paths while satisfying parameter pair combinations in the process. First impression of int=3 and SOURCE was that they are a dead end - and since first-impressions-last the other values seemed like better candidates for uncovering hidden execution paths and therefore they were initially untrusted with higher priority.

## Simpliest Possible Parameterization: [FalseOrTrue.pickBoolean(displayOnTrue)](https://javadoc.io/static/org.lazyparams/lazyparams/latest/org/lazyparams/showcase/FalseOrTrue.html#pickBoolean(java.lang.CharSequence))
Isn't the simpliest possible parameter one that can only have values true or false? Though being very simple it is nevertheless kind of a big deal when relying on LazyParams to seek out corner cases that require special treatment during a test.
